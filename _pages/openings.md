## Open positions

**Our lab will mainly use computational approaches combined with experiments to understand RNA virus and RNA structure at gene expression regulation and structural levels. Specifically, we use RNA structure prediction and RNA design to udnerstand and engineer RNA molecules. We are hosting the [RNA-Puzzles](http://www.rnapuzzles.org), which is a world-wide community efforts in evaluation of RNA 3D structure prediction. We explore RNA structural biology using a combination of X-ray crystallography, chemical probing, artificial intelligence and computational modeling. Besides, we use single-cell multi-omics to understand the human immune response to RNA viruses, neuron development and immune cell development. We develop computational algorithms to deal with key bottlenecks in single-cell analysis (e.g.,batch effect, cell type clustering, cell type deconvolution). We also develop cloud computing platform and big data atlases for single-cell omics.** 

**We are always looking for creative, energetic and collaborative researchers to join our interdisciplinary team!**


### Associate Investigator
The candidates should have a Ph.D. in computational biology/bioinformatics/computer science/statistics or other quantitative fields, as well as excellent programming and communication skills. Substantial experience in analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is highly desirable.

Candidates with a Ph.D. degree in cell biology, molecular biology, immunology (etc.) with substantial experience and interest in quantitative fields/programming are also welcomed to apply.

The candidates would have ability to develop independent research programs/projects, and candidates with experience in postdoctoral training or research and strong record in research are strongly preferred.

The successful candidates will join a vibrant scientific environment devoted to basic science aiming at integrating research activities among partner institutes and conduct interdisciplinary research to address high-priority projects through the combination of complementary knowledge, methods and techniques.

If you are interested in joining us, please send us an email along with a brief cover letter, a detailed CV and at least two recommendation letters. Please indicate “Application Associate Investigator (Your name)” in the email subject.
